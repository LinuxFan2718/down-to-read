# Down To Read
A virtual bookshelf of your Kindle books

## How to use

Install the browser extension.

Click the browser extension icon.

If this is your first time, it needs to see which books you have by visiting
read.amazon.com. The extension will read this page to see which books are on
your bookshelf. (The extension is read-only and the code is open source.)

Now, simply click the icon and your virtual bookshelf will be displayed. You
are ready for a houseguest!
